"""`/api/song/{f}?stems=1` — the playable stem list, for preloading.

The stems plugin could only learn its stem list from the highway's WS `ready`,
which arrives once the highway is already up. So it decoded the stems and then
copied the whole song's PCM to its audio worklet with the player on screen —
half a gigabyte of memcpy in one frame, ~700 ms, which froze the venue video.

Given the list at `song:loading` it can do all of that BEFORE the highway
appears, behind the loading overlay where a stall costs nothing.

The safety property these tests exist for: the REST payload must be the SAME
list the WS builds. If they disagree, the plugin preloads one graph and then
throws it away and rebuilds another — strictly worse than not preloading. So
they are pinned against each other, not just against a snapshot.

    would say "no full mix" while the WS said there was one. The plugin would then
