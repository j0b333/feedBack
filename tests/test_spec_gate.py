"""Regression tests for the feedpak spec-conformance gate.

The gate (tools/check_spec_conformance.py) is what keeps the app from drifting
away from the feedpak spec, so the gate itself must not be weakenable by a
quiet refactor: these tests pin its load-bearing behaviours — read/write
classification, the closed allowlist, and the duplicate/malformed-entry
rejections. If one of these fails, the spec's protection regressed.
