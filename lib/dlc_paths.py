"""DLC library path resolution — where the song files live, plus safe containment.

Extracted from ``server.py`` (R3). ``_resolve_dlc_path`` is pure and moved
verbatim. ``_get_dlc_dir`` reads the env-derived paths through the ``appstate``
seam (``server.py`` configures ``dlc_dir``/``dlc_dir_env``/``config_dir`` at
import, fresh on every re-import), so this module does no import-time IO and the
pop-and-reimport fixtures keep working. ``server.py`` re-exports both names, so
existing ``server._get_dlc_dir`` / ``server._resolve_dlc_path`` references
(tests, other handlers) resolve unchanged.

    """Resolve `filename` under DLC_DIR and refuse anything that escapes.

    `filename` arrives from `:path` route params and can contain `..`
    segments. The Sloppak and archive paths happen to fail safely later
    because their loaders raise on missing/invalid files, but loose-
    folder format detection (`is_loose_song`) globs and parses XML on
    disk first, which lets a crafted path trigger filesystem reads
    outside DLC_DIR before any guard fires. Centralise the containment
    check so every filename-bound handler validates before touching the
    filesystem.

    Containment here is LEXICAL (normalize `.`/`..` WITHOUT following
    symlinks), not `safe_join`'s `.resolve()`-based check — because users
    commonly mount their song library through a directory JUNCTION/symlink
    (a library shared across app installs; the desktop app's own mounts).
    `.resolve()` follows that junction to its real target, sees it sits
    outside DLC_DIR, and wrongly rejects every song reached through it — the
    scanner's `rglob` indexes those songs, but art/load then 403/404s (broken
    covers, unplayable songs). Lexical normalization still rejects the only
    escapes a `:path` filename can express — `..` traversal and absolute
    paths — which the traversal tests pin. `safe_join` stays strict (it is
    the zip-slip / plugin-asset guard, where following a symlink out IS the
    defense); the loose-folder art handler keeps its own per-file symlink
    re-check for defence-in-depth.

    Returns the validated Path (not necessarily link-resolved), or None if
    the filename is empty, contains a NUL, or escapes the DLC root.
