    on screen — half a gigabyte of memcpy in one frame, ~700 ms, freezing the
    venue video. Given the list at `song:loading` it can do all of that BEFORE the
    highway appears, behind the loading overlay where a stall costs nothing.

    The list MUST be the same one the WS sends a moment later. If it is not, the
    plugin preloads a graph and then throws it away and rebuilds — strictly worse
    than not preloading. So this does not reimplement the WS's construction, it
    calls THE SAME FUNCTION: load_song, whose LoadedSloppak already carries the
    partitioned stems and the resolved full mix, and then builds the URLs exactly
    as ws_highway does. Drift is impossible by construction rather than by
    agreement — which matters, because `full_mix` in particular is not simply the
    `full` stem: load_song falls back to the deprecated `original_audio:` key for
    every pack written before feedpak 1.15.0, and reimplementing that (I did, at
    first) silently dropped the pristine full mix for most real libraries.

    Opt-in (`?stems=1`) so the library's own metadata calls — the hot path — pay
    nothing for it. Non-sloppak sources (archives, loose folders) have no stems
    to preload: load_song raises and we return the empty list.
